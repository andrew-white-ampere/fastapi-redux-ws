# fastapi-redux-ws 

This project uses [redux-postgrest-demo](https://github.com/andytango/redux-postgrest-demo) as a starting point to develop a framework with the goal of facilitating live, stateful edits to a system by multiple users concurrently through the use of [fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), [postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres), [postgres-websockets](https://github.com/diogob/postgres-websockets), and [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit).
